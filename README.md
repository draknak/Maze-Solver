# Maze-Solver

Java maze solver that goes through a 2d char array (maze) trying to solve it.

The following are the different types of chars that create the maze and path taken

\# = walls 

' ' = empty

\* = traversed

@ = current pos

& = backtrack


---

Planning to add ability to load a maze from text file and also some other search algorithms (breadth, depth, etc)
